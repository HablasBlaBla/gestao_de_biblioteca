# Bug Fix Plan for Profile Picture Functionality

## 1. Review the Profile Picture Display Logic in perfil.php
- Ensure that the path to the profile picture is correctly constructed.
- Verify that the default image is displayed when no profile picture is set.

## 2. Review the File Upload Logic in atualizar_perfil.php
- Confirm that the uploaded file is being saved correctly in the `_uploads/fp_alunos/` directory.
- Ensure that the file type validation is functioning as expected.
- Check that the database is updated with the new profile picture path.

## 3. Test the Profile Update Functionality
- Upload a new profile picture and verify that it appears on the profile page.
- Test the scenario where no new picture is uploaded to ensure the existing picture remains.

## 4. Error Handling
- Improve error messages for better user feedback during file upload failures.
- Ensure that the application gracefully handles any unexpected errors.

## 5. Final Testing
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as intended after the fixes.
